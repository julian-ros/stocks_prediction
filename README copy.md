# Sales Forecast Prediction using Prophet

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and data related to the sales forecast prediction using Prophet, a Python library for time series analysis.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- pandas==1.3.3
- prophet==1.0.1
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- seaborn==0.11.2

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in CSV format in the `data` folder. The data contains monthly sales data for different products and regions.

## Scripts

The `helpers` folder contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies listed above.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Run the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
5. Open the notebooks in the Jupyter notebook server that appears in your web browser.

## Functionality

The Jupyter notebooks provide data validation and exploration functionalities to generate sales forecast predictions using Prophet. The notebooks also compare the performance of different models and parameters using various metrics.

## Installing Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. Jupyter Notebook is included in the Anaconda distribution. Here are the steps to install Anaconda and run Jupyter Notebook:

1. Download Anaconda from the official website. Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once Anaconda is installed, you can use the Anaconda Navigator, a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) included in Anaconda distributions, to launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. In the Anaconda Navigator, click on the 'Launch' button in the Jupyter Notebook tile. This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Remember, before running the Jupyter notebook, navigate to the directory containing the notebook using the command line (or terminal on MacOS/Linux).
